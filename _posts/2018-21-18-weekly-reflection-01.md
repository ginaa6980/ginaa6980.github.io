Today, class was somewhat boring because im used to coding in "Dreamweaver" and not Github so i didnt know where to start. Luckily, One of my partners who was sitting next to me, lemuel had helped me. I have learned that coding in github is hard beacuse theres so many steps in order to make one page in  a website. My biggest challenge so far was tring to understand how does github work and getting used to it and finding out the steps in order to code a proper website
