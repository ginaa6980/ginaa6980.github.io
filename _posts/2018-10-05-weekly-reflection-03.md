I have learned that values have to be in order. If not, the computer is unable to reconize the code written. THe values are called arguemnts and are telling the function what to do. So far, the order of the values are very important. We tell the computer what to do and they do the work for us. Whick i find very cool. Todays week was very fun because we are able to connect definitons with our own together as a group and we did fun activities such as making the flag.
