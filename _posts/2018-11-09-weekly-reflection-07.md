This week, we have focused more on Problems for fast functions. Which is basically like contracts and we are supposed to analyze it. I wasnt very confused about because we were introduced to contracts before. I have learned that its closly related to math, specifically Algebra. For example theres domain and range. The result would be the range and what we put in for example, we put in variables that would be the domain because we are giving the computer something. The range would be the result. I have also learned that parenthesis are very important becuase if your missing one, the function wont work. Order is very important. You can also change the size of shapes if you use for exmaple "(BT size) (trangle size "solid" "blue"))" the computer knows the varible can be infinite amounts of numbers and you put down any type of number on the right side and press "Enter" and boom you get a blue triangle of any size. This can work with any color,shape and name long as you tell the computer the variable name.
