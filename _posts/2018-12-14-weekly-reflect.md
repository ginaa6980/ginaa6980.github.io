This week, we were working rigorously on our flags. First, Mr.Allata had to teach us little bit more on the code before we actually started coding. Instead of actually putting all the numbers we could just replace the numbers and use define values making it more conveinent to change the flag size. When I started making the flag, I had to make sure the flag and the stripes were geometric. Then I had to replace the numbers with values.
