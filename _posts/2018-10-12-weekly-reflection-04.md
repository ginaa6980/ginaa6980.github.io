This week, we have observed more about shapes. For example we have used shapes to make a flag. This was significant because we learned how shapes and sizes are used in the coding language called "racket". I have learned that that "outline" is the outter color of a shape and "solid" can fill the whole color. The challenging part was to too put two shapes at one time and where to put the parenthesis if we didnt do this correctly, the computer couldnt read the code and there would be no shape.
