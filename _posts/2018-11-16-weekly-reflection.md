This week I have learned one major thing,Expressions have alot inside. Like values and functions. Functions produces and values dont change. A function is made up of values. An exmaple of this would be (define gt size)(trangle size "solid" "green").The solid and the green wouldnt chnage just the size. Also we have learned the idea of how we are able to create images anf put it down on the computer, it may not be real but we can create many things.
