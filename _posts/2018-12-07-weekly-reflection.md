This week, we were supposed to find the relationship between shapes and measuremnts and by this we had to make a flag. I decided to choose the puetro rican flag. First, we had to learn more about our flag before making it, because of this we went to "Fotw.org." I have leaned that most flags including the puetro rican flag have red, which mean the blood sheed for their country.The next day, we start making the flags. We were given scrap colored paper and white paper, sciccors,glue and a ruler.  making it was difficult because i had to know the exact measurements to cut for EVERY piece of paper i cut.it was 4 by 6 and each strip was 1 inch.
