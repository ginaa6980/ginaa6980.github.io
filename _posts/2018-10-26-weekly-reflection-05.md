Since the past 6 weeks we had for computer science, it was very confusing, fun and interesting all in one. When we have learned and taken notes for the first time, we have learned whats a web and what is programming and the huge vairty of languages the proffesionals use like HTML and CSS. CSS is mainly used for styling and HTML structures and rendering helps us view HTML. Then, we were introduced to Github its a program used to make websites using HTML and CSS and we are supposed to blog there every week. On the same day, we were learned how folders contain files and inside those files they have text and repositories. This useful becuase in github, to be able to make a funtional website, you need to know what are folders and files and they contain text like this one that im writting right now. I was confused because I didnt know how to actually create folders and put in files inside. 
Todays week was very fun and more interesting than last weeks, we were able to start on the new game we have been planing since last month.
